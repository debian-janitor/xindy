xindy (2.1.99+2.2-beta2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release; closes: #362584

  * This is upstream version 2.2-beta2. Because 2.2 is not newer than
    2.2-beta2 for dpkg this curious version is used.

  * Moved the files in the directory /usr/lib/xindy/modules/ to the more
    FHS-compatible directory /usr/share/xindy/, because they are
    architecture-independent.
