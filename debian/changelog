xindy (2.2~beta2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed the build rules (in debian/rules) to use different configure
    calls for the different targets build-indep and build-arch. For
    build-arch, configure is instructed to build no documentation and
    make-rules, because latex is not available. (closes: #424976)

  * Removed tetex-extra as a possible build dependency, because it's
    removed from Debian.

  * Upload is sponsored by Norbert Preining.

xindy (2.2~beta2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release; closes: #362584

  * Moved the files in the directory /usr/lib/xindy/modules/ to the more
    FHS-compatible directory /usr/share/xindy/, because they are
    architecture-independent.

  * Upload is sponsored by Norbert Preining
