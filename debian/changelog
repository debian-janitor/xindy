xindy (2.3-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream release

  * Removed external-clisp.dpatch, fix-cleanup.dpatch, fix-serbian.dpatch
    and fix-errors.dpatch. All are applied to the upstream source.

  * Rebuilt the manual pages tex2xindy.1, texindy.1 and xindy.1 at
    buildtime to fix the hyphen vs. minus sign problems. Removed the
    patch fix-manpage.dpatch.

  * Adapted fix-FHS.dpatch to the new sources.

  * Made the path to clisp more generic. (closes: #458883)

  * Added workaround for broken clisp.
    + Clisp generates a broken rte/ordrules/ordrulei.c which includes
      undefined data types. Fixed by removing this lines from the
      generated file.

    + clisp-link calls the linker with -ldb, but a libdb.so doesn't
      exist. Clisp itself is linked against libdb-4.6. Due to this I
      replace the -ldb by -ldb-4.6 in the file makevars.

    + clisp-link links the binary with libSM and libICE while
      dpkg-shlibdeps complains no symbols are used from these libraries.
      Removed them from the linker call.

  * Used the (new) real header instead of the Homepage pseudo header.

xindy (2.2~beta2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Acknowledge NMU. (closes: #424976)

  * Excluded arm, hppa, ia64, m68k, mipsel and s390 from the list of
    supported architectures. For every other architecture the clisp
    maintainer had enabled FFI support, at least in version 1:2.41-1.

xindy (2.2~beta2-2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU of the sponsor to really fix the build issue
  * make the build target in debian/rules emtpy, binary-arch and
    binary-indep does everything (Closes: #424976)

xindy (2.2~beta2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed the build rules (in debian/rules) to use different configure
    calls for the different targets build-indep and build-arch. For
    build-arch, configure is instructed to build no documentation and
    make-rules, because latex is not available. (closes: #424976)

  * Removed tetex-extra as a possible build dependency, because it's
    removed from Debian.

  * Upload is sponsored by Norbert Preining.

xindy (2.2~beta2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release; closes: #362584

  * Moved the files in the directory /usr/lib/xindy/modules/ to the more
    FHS-compatible directory /usr/share/xindy/, because they are
    architecture-independent.

  * Upload is sponsored by Norbert Preining
