  * Acknowledge NMU. (closes: #424976)

  * Excluded arm, hppa, ia64, m68k, mipsel and s390 from the list of
    supported architectures. For every other architecture the clisp
    maintainer had enabled FFI support, at least in version 1:2.41-1.

xindy (2.2~beta2-2.1) unstable; urgency=low

    binary-indep does everything (Closes: #424976)

xindy (2.2~beta2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed the build rules (in debian/rules) to use different configure
    calls for the different targets build-indep and build-arch. For
    build-arch, configure is instructed to build no documentation and
    make-rules, because latex is not available. (closes: #424976)

  * Removed tetex-extra as a possible build dependency, because it's
    removed from Debian.

  * Upload is sponsored by Norbert Preining.

xindy (2.2~beta2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release; closes: #362584

  * Moved the files in the directory /usr/lib/xindy/modules/ to the more
    FHS-compatible directory /usr/share/xindy/, because they are
    architecture-independent.

  * Upload is sponsored by Norbert Preining
