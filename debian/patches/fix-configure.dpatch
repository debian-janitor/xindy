## fix-configure.dpatch by JÃ¶rg Sommer <joerg@alea.gnuu.de>
##
## All lines beginning with `## DP:' are a description of the patch.
## DP: The grouping of the check for latex and pdflatex is not correct,
## DP: which causes configure failes with --disable-make-rules and
## DP: --disable-docs. This patch is only a ugly workaround. A better
## DP: patch was send upstream.
