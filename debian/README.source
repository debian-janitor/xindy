This package uses dpatch to manage all modifications to the upstream
source.  Changes are stored in the source package in debian/patches and
applied during the build.  Please see:

    /usr/share/doc/dpatch/README.source

for more information on how to apply the patches, modify patches, or
remove a patch.
